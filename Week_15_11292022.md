### Question: How would deep learning neural networks would benefit your current research?

#### Article 1
https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/38/4/1176/6426068

https://miandata.org/

##### Neural network utilizing
Machine Learning: Linear Regressor , Linear classifier, and Random Forest classifier
Deep learning: multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) to predict a numerical or categorical variable

##### what is the research question
It is GUI for analyzing microbiome datasets and includes several ML algorithms and a deeplearning algorithm


#### Article 2
https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-63159-5

##### Neural network utilizing
Shallow autoencoder (SAE), deep autoencoder (DAE), variational autoencoder (VAE), and convolutional autoencoder (CAE)

##### what is the research question
A tool created utilizing neural networks for understand disease groups and the microbiome relationship 
"deploys various autoencoders to learn robust low-dimensional representations from high-dimensional microbiome profiles and trains classification models based on the learned representation."


#### Article 3
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8531731/

##### Neural network utilizing
This is more a lit review so mentions many like convolutional neural networks (CNN), recurrent neural networks (RNN), and graph convolutional neural networks (GCN)
##### what is the research question
This paper discusses how deep learning is helping to identify key signatures and phenotypes from plant microbiota

They discuss several areas of interst for Deep learning:

1)Deciphering Species Composition of Microbiome Data
2)Functional Analysis by Deep Learning Methods aka gene prediction
3)Directly Predicting the Host Phenotype
