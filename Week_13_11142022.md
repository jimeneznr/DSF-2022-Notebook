## Rose:
We are beginning our lessons on Machine learning some of the methods I did not fully know were ML, but after discussion I could see how they may be used. I asked Carlos about other methods and best practices for determining if your data is not suitable for ML or it is the algorithm in which you are using. Carlos mentioned using at least three methods and then determining from there. Our lab currently utilizes Random Forest but I am unsure it is the best method for our datasets.

## Bud: 
I presented on the skeleton of the biorepository I am creating in FOSS, this repository has been delayed with code and analysis as I have been pulled away for other projects. I might start another repository for those projects and then present to my lab so they can add there Code, documentation, or video of the software they are using( I know Github is limited on space but unsure where else to put the materials). 

## Thorn: 
This is the last week of FOSS, so sad it is ending there is still a lot I think I could learn. Howevever, THe cyverse group said we could come to them on the SLACK channel if we need help in the future with any of the topics they covered.

We utilized three methods on the diabetes cohort and determined that 3/4 methods were ideal with one method varying in results we determined this by the accuracy score.
