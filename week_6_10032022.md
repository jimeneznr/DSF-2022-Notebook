## Rose: 

Invested time on taxonomic classification databases on open databases and private databases and discussed in grant the pros and cons of the usage of either database. 
Reviewed soteria usage and application, unsure our lab will be able to use but useful information for future projects. 

### Bud: 

Created an OSF page for project, listened to OSF tutorial. Found out several lab GUI tools recently were updated with open source code packages for reproducibility. 
Also allows for modification of the code our input files, which previously had to be done with not reproducible methods such as excel modification and adobe photoshop. 

## Thorn:
