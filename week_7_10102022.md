## Rose:
Made one site for project using instructions from Github pages, made one site named after me from instructions from FOSS. Then met with Greg and learned how 
to integrate R and Github to make a website in R. The website still need project and personal touches included. FOSS lesson this week talked about Cyverse, Vice, and the commanlineWe learned to sync github with the commandline. Unsure I will use it this way, but was nice to start to see the capabilities of Cyverse. Most of the lessons on commandline this week will be useful for me interfacing with my desktop and with the HPC. Carlos's lesson also introduced some commands I had not utilized before, forked that information for later. 

## Bud:
Was able to fork repositories from Greg Chism (R code) and Carlos Lizarraga (python, github) for usage and notes to come back to later. I started following DSF folks on githuband building out other DS contacts on Github. I attended python workshop this week by Carlos to learn visualizations and started diggin into visuals that I might find usefulto best show my datasets. Found out that one of the pages on basic microbiome analysis from a colleague of mine was actually using Github pages so that was neat to see come full circle.I also wrote up an Nature journal club article with a BMA member on a viral database(GVD)paper that is being stored on CyVerse/iVirus so that was also great to see the world's coming together. 

## Thorn:
We did not have full run down of commandline activity, but Carlos did provide a chapter of a book using Cyverse and the commandline to run with RNA-seq data. 
I still need to run through this activity.
