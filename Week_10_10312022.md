Rose:We started off the week talking about about scientific writing and the literature discussed was very systematic on how to write manuscripts. Great for communication, 
but unsure I will utilize the tricks in the future as I have been utilizing others. Last week our lesson was also on running statistical methods in R and how to interpret
the methods with certain datasets. Following we during Foss we discussed containers and how to utilize docker on cyverse. We ended the week discussing our group challenge 
which utilized R to run basic stats on our own data sets

Bud: I was able to utilize R this week, which I am a bit more comfortable with than other tools we have utilized so far. I made scatterplots and ran logistic regressions on 
my projects dataset mostly the metadata and looked into vaginal pH, number of atopobiaceae species and BMI. However, after discussin with the group since none of the values 
except BMI were genuinely continous they were more on a scale that logistic regression may not be the best way to analyze the data. I was utilizing mostly due to the previous example 
that week but we determined a poisson regression model might be useful if i still wanted to look at the relationship of these variables. I think in total I am still learning the main ideas
but will take bits and pieces of what I learn and incoporate incrementaly. I also solidified again this week how to commit and push commits to github in R through projects, which is another
useful tip for the future when I publish my R code. 

This is the weekly challenge: https://github.com/jimeneznr/DSF_Intro_R/blob/main/stats_practice.pdf

Thorn:I am still confused on containers and why docker does not work on my desktop, I believe it has something to do with admin rights to the desktop. Due to this I am unsure
useful it is to utilize containers for my current analyses. I think if I utilized cyverse further I could overcome this issue, but the idea of containers is still confusing.
