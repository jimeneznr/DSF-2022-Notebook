Wrote down wrong data actually week_8_10172022


Rose: I had lessons from our COM-P librarian about DistillerSR and utlizing to set-up my lab's systematic review.  I took learned there were multiple 
ways how to integrate automated filtration and how to make all screening transparent. I have been advocating for this tool as it also incoprates AI and make sure the whole process is transparent and registered for other scientists to review.

Bud: We learned to utilize R this week in cyverse from Greg, I unfortunately did not know that computational time was monitered and that just exiting does not stop the instance and 
had my cyverse time restricted. reached out to cyverse and was able to get it reinstated due to DSF and FOSS. Once that was done I was able to work throught the challenge and 
get a modfied R code to the lesson Tuesday put up on the Github here https://github.com/jimeneznr/DSF_Intro_R. 

Thorn: Missed Friday special lecture, do to being out of town need to make-up the time.

Additional information:

I also linked the UA-CoM-P offices with Luisa in order to circulate the workshops to faculty and postdocs interested in learning about Data Science/Open science. 
In addition, I linked Luisa with a professor in the department of Biomedical informatics which is also interested in assisting in circulating workshop information 
and helping host/support coffee/social data science meet-ups. 

I also joined another slack channel this week from my microbiome workshop over the summer called ubioinfo, lots of conversation on microbiological bioinformatics.
