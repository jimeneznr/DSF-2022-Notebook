## Rose: 

Our group challenge we discussed cyverse a bit as well as VS. We had interesting conversations about project documentation and management in FOSS this week. Lots of discussion on what tools folks use and how well they document projects and code that is readable to come back for not only the lab, but also yourself. I signed up for OSF and started setting up a project unsure how often I will use since none of my lab is on it, but I think it is cool I can have plugins for box, google drive, figshare and github. I tried to use onedrive as well but IT was unable to make that work out due to policies around microsoft and UA owned desktop computers. 

## Bud: 
Created a Jupyter Notebook practice sheet on UA HPC https://github.com/jimeneznr/DSF-2022-Notebook/blob/main/EMC_Notes_practice.ipynb 
I was able to upload the jupyter notebook  practice sheet to a new repository. I tried out google collab but was unsure how to move my data to google collab without having my data on google drive. Need to look into this. I was able to set up jupyter notebook on the HPC and install the qiime2 versions as custom kernels on the HPC. I then met with the developers of qiime2 to assess the documentation and that I was utlizing it properly. I then was able to practice using one of my datasets. still need to look into more about the separate python packages. 


## Thorn:
I need to write in my journal during the week, because I forget all the items I have done during the week. Too much on my mind.


## Additional information:

The Phoenix DSF fellows met to take photos for DSF, we took a morning and had headshots outside, together as a group. We even had pictures for the wet bench components 
of our research.
