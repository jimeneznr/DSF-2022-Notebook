## Rose

This week our Journal Club was more of a video tutorial on ML, I kind of wish these were presented earlier as there is a lot of material to go through but I was able to get through the first set of videos. I plan to watch the rest next week and the following as I think it will be beneficial in the long term for the lab and my goals of incorporating ML. https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/machine-learning-tutorial

## Bud

This week was a shortened week due to the holiday, I was not able to attend the lecture but I found the notes here and reviewed. https://github.com/clizarraga-UAD7/Notebooks/blob/main/ML_Classification.ipynb and https://github.com/clizarraga-UAD7/Notebooks/blob/main/Intro_UnsupervisedLearning1.ipynb

## Thorn

The only struggle I forsee with ML is that we are currently learning on Python and I still do not feel the most comfortable utilizing python, so I hope to find some algorithms that are available via R or in some cases QIIME2.

## Weekly Challenge

We decided to work individually on the challenge this week due to the holiday, but Kiana communicated to the group her issues with importing the data which helped us move forward. I am still working on this challenge but hope to have done by our next challenge.  

+ the performance of each Classifier algorithm based on the metrics defined there and observe what would be the best option and worse one.
