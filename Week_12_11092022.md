## Rose: 
This week we discussed data visualization and had a paper on data visualization utilizing tableu, I have bought a subscription to tableu to create one figure since I was having trouble in R. But the coding language plus point and click was too confusing.I ended up putting that figure on the backburner. Howver, I can see the usefulness of tableu for dashboard. I am just unsure if this type of data is useful for my current projects. 

## Bud: 
this week I was trying to upload the Data visaulization exercise and was having trouble having the figure show up. I was baffled and asked heidi her opinion, after troubleshooting many things it was simply that this whole semester I though I was writing in markdown. However, I was writing in text files. the change was simple make the text files markdown. We thought the best way to do this was to write my journals via Rstudio and utilize quarto to make my markdown files and then I could showcase that document via html hosted on a github.io site. We later learned the simpler change was to simply edit the file name from Week_12_11092022 to Week_12_11092022.md. I learned a lot in this process and  although I may simply create the journals/learning logs on github with the .md. I think the quarto to github pages is nice for my repository project for FOSS and will try to implement next week. 

I also am participating in a journal article with STORMS (https://www.stormsmicrobiome.org/) , we will be evaluating recent microbiome articles and how well they incorporate the STORMS Checklist for transparency of data collection/processing/analysis, reproducibility, and standardization of methods. 

## Thorn:

Do to my many many collaborator projects I am having trouble dedicating time to my independent project and fleshing out my repository. I think due to this I might create other repositories for my other collaborator projects so that I can work in tandem with the concepts I am learning and also finalize the projects my PI has listed as high priority. That said, I will try to dedicate some more time next week in develop even an outline of the code for this project.
