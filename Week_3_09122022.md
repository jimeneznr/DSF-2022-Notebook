## Rose:
- We read articles on Open science, I think understanding now that the term is very broad and it can mean different things to different people. I think explaining this concept 
to my lab will be easier with FAIR/CARE principles in mind. 

## Bud:
- I was able to begin sign-up for DS courses that run on R and python,I do have to move some meetings in order to attend them. However, Greg and Carlos take very good notes
have readable code that I can also practice on my "downtime" 

## Thorn:
- I was able to get docker installed to for FOSS workshop and I have ubuntu but they are not cooperating with one another, Maliaca mentioned the use of cloud servers 
which may be the best option. note: research computers are notoriously difficult to work with due to restricted access rights. However, I did talk with IT and they said there
was a way I can update my admin rights so that I will not encounter this type of issue again. 

## Additional information:
- First FOSS session was this week and learned a lot of local and national tools on open-access journals and Rxiv repositories , which we discussed on some with Maliaca as well
- I also asked the group about Data science mentors for a BIO5 postdoctoral fellowship and many suggested their applications and others reccommended Dr. Bonnie Hurwitz as a mentor

## Useful tips for my research/Lab:
- Learned that UA libraries have some funds to help with paying for open-access - Learned via Foss
