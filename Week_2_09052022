Dear DSF Journal, 

This was the first full week of interacting with the group and attending the workshop/class events! It was exciting and a bit overwhelming, 
I think all change is that way at first. I hope overtime that it will be more manageable. 

Some of the items that were most pertinent this week were introductions, discussing wiki pages, what our ideas on open science were and then ended the week
with a great talk from Dr. Lydia Jennings. 

I was able to look further into All of US platform for both analyses purposes, I am looking forward to when there is a biospecimen componenet added
such as microbiome samples. I also signed up as a participant, I thought their videos about repositories and consent were very thorough all thought the surveys 
could use more specificity. I think entering as participant gives me more perspective on the downstream output of the data and may help inform how hypothesis questions are formed.


We also talked about FAIR/CARE principles and got information on University of Arizona Resources. I ended up talking with my lab and we are thinking of having a trainee
Look into these resources and discuss at a general lab meeting. 

DSF also discussed how the changes in data availability and data management plans for NIH grants might affect the our upcoming submission and reviewing the UA resources 
could help us be more competitive and obviously practice FAIR principles. 

I also enjoyed Lydia Jennings talk and a lot of the resources she mentioned or povided via her website could be used with my projects with UA Native American Cancer Prevention
projects!

Overall excited about what I have learned thus far!
