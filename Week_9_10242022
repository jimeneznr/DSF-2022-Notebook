Rose: Learned Statistics with Greg and excited to utilize the exercise to get some additional information from my postdoc prject data, especially linear regressions 
of which I have not have performed in awhile. Also met with Greg this week to troubleshoot a statistical R package output and how to distill in to easily digestable 
visualization for my non-data focused collaborators. I love a table, but some of my colleagues prefer graphics. It was my goal to help automate the visual in the 
analysis pipeline and also make it reproducible instead of opting for  excel manipulate than input into a visual stas package like prism. 

Bud: Learned about scientific writing this week in journal club and carlos presented several new tools for look for connected research articles. I mentioned another 
link called open knowledge maps. All these tools utilize AI to scan through literature databases. I also suggested two academic writing books. I learned about netlify drop
for html publishing, I could not get to work with the data I had set up. However, I was able to create a pdf and shared the weekly challenge 
https://github.com/jimeneznr/DSF_Intro_R/blob/main/stats_practice.pdf. I plan to take Greg and Heidi's advice and look into poisson regressions, but ultimately might use
more statistical methods appropriate for microbiome analysis. 

Thorn:Greg also taught us how to git commit from R studio/cyverse for our weekly challenge, since others in group were interested. Still learning and trying to remember everything.
