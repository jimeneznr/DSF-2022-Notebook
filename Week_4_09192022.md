## Rose: 
- For our weekly Challenge I created the project repository for the DSF fellowship and FOSS, the group discussed benefits of private and public repositories. However, 
after discussion with my PI we thought it would be best to make private until publication. I also noted this in my grant report as a benefit 
for after the project is completed and for other data scientists to have access to the code to run similiar studies for other cohorts. 

-In this weekly challenge we also discussed differences in licenses and most of us thought the MIT was sufficient, 
but if we did have patent pending work some of the others could as well.

## Bud:
- Joined Carlos's class on Python and Jupyter notebook, was able to get the desktop version installed and launch the HPC version. I am hopeful to use this tool in the 
future as semester progresses.
- I need to plan time to meet with Greg Caporaso's group to dicuss Jupyter notebooks with Qiime2 usage
- I need to read-up on how to install the qiime2 plug-in with Jupyter notebooks as well

## Thorn:
- I was traveling this week, so I missed the in-person session of FOSS but glad they are able to upload videos and notes. The project management component and tips were help
as I think about my project repository and future steps. I think some of these tips will be useful as I have discussion with my lab on how to implement reducing point and click steps
, keeping raw data raw or notating what has been done for preprocessing if it was not kept raw. 
- We also discussed what Cyverse was and I think this tool can be helpful for the future and will be neat to learn more as the course progresses
- Tuesday's discussion was short and just about our thoughts again on Open-science, would like to have more hands on exercises or thought exercise next class to really work
on producing open-science.
